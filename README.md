ChatWithPerson (CWP) is an AI experiment that merges the technical prowess of *ThisPersonDoesNotExist*, *ThisRentalDoesNotExist*, and *TalkToTransformer*. With CWP, anyone can chat with peronalities generated on-the-spot. From the profile picture to the words in the messenger, everything has been generated using some Neural Network. The following models have been used when making this project:

| Aspect          | Model                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Profile Picture | Deep Convolutional GAN     |
| Speech          | Transformer with Attention |
| Name            | Character-level LSTM       |
| Biography       | Transformer with Attention |
| Address         | Character-level LSTM       |

At times, the grammar, spelling, and punctuation may be incorrect. As these models are not trained under perfect conditions, they may not have generalised what they are being fed. Do remember that this is purely an experiment.
